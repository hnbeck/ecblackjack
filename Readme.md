## README for ECBlackJack experimental game

ECBlackJachis a simple implementation  of Black Jack using [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) and [Tau-Prolog](http://www.tau-prolog.org). Graphics is done by [p5.js](http://p5js.org). There is nothing to win, and it is not
a full implementation of Black Jack. The intention is to try out things.

The idea is to test a web browser based interface for a SWI-Prolog applications using the Pengines library and Tau Prolog. The intention in the backstage is to try out structure and logic programming in combination of procedural programming.

## Usage

You need a SWI Prolog 8.x.x installation. Start the file ecBJServer.pl to start the server. In the web browser head to http://localhost:7007 to start the game. If graphics does not come not up just reload.

## README for ECBlackJack experimental game

ECBlackJack is a simple implementation  of Black Jack using [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) and [Tau-Prolog](http://www.tau-prolog.org)

The idea is to test a Web browser based interface for a SWI-Prolog application using the Pengines library. 

## State

The game is under development and not very functional at the moment. Goal is to develop it further to a playable game using JavaScript libraries for graphics.

## Acknowledgements

This code is build with the help of Anne Ogborn, Paul Brown, Jos√© a Riaza and others in the Twitter community. 

Thanks!
